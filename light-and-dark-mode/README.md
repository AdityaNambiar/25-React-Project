# 🌟 Project 8: Light and Dark Mode 🌓

```
In this project, we've delved into the realm of user experience enhancement by implementing 
both Light and Dark modes seamlessly. Here's a glimpse into our approach:
```

## 🔍 Approach:
- Theme Transition: We've empowered our website users with the ability to switch between Light and Dark modes effortlessly. Now, whether they prefer a soothing light ambiance or a sleek dark interface, they have the freedom to choose what suits them best.
- Persistent Settings: Leveraging the power of custom hooks, we've ensured that user preferences persist across sessions. By storing theme data in local storage, we've eliminated the hassle of users having to reset their preferences every time they revisit the site. Seamlessly consistent experiences await every time they return!

```
This project not only adds a touch of personalization but also enhances accessibility and usability, 
making our website a more inclusive space for all users.
