# Custom Scroll Indicator

```
In this React project, we've implemented a sleek 
solution to fetch data dynamically from a URL as you scroll.
```

### Approach:
1. Dynamic Data Fetching: We've integrated a mechanism to fetch data dynamically through a URL. As users scroll, the application intelligently fetches additional data, providing a smooth and uninterrupted browsing experience.

2. Event Listener Implementation: Instead of relying on third-party libraries, we've implemented a custom event listener. This approach enhances the project's efficiency and ensures better control over the scrolling behavior.
