# ðŸš€ Load More Data! ðŸš€

```
This project was all about creating a smooth user experience 
by implementing a "Load More" button. The goal? 
To fetch and display products incrementally, enhancing performance and usability.
```

### Here's a brief overview:

## ðŸ›  Approach:

1. Data Source: Utilized [dummyjson's](https://dummyjson.com/) product API for mock data.
2. Initial Load: Displays 20 products initially.
3. On Demand: Clicking the "Load More" button fetches additional products, improving page load times and user engagement.
4. Limit: Set a cap at 100 products to maintain performance. Once reached, the button is disabled with a friendly message: "You have reached the end".

```
This project sharpened my skills in handling API requests, managing state, and improving
user interactions in React applications. The use of dummyjson.com was instrumental in providing
a reliable source of mock data for development and testing.
