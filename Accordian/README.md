# Accordian

### ðŸš€ Quick Insight: Navigating a React Coding Challenge! ðŸš€

 I faced an intriguing challenge:

- Task: Develop both a single selection and a multi-selection accordion.
- Approach: Leveraged reusable components for efficiency and maintainability.
- Styling: Utilized position: absolute for elements (except the Accordion) relative to their container for a neat UI.

### Challenge Encountered: The multi-selection accordion tested my skills in managing complex UI states and ensuring a smooth user experience.

```
// Finding difficulty in creating this function
  function handleMultipleSelection(currentId) {
    setExpandedItems(prevExpandedItems => {
      const isExpanded = prevExpandedItems.includes(currentId);
      if (isExpanded) {
        // Remove id from the array
        return prevExpandedItems.filter(id => id !== currentId);
      } else {
        // Add id to the array
        return [...prevExpandedItems, currentId];
      }
    });
  }

```

Key Takeaways:

- Reusability and CSS Mastery: Essential for efficient and scalable development.
- State Management: Crucial for dynamic UI components.
