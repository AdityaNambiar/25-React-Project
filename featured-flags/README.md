# Featured Flags - React Project
### Project Overview
```
Project 15, 
Featured Flags, is a React application designed to manage feature flags in a production environment containing multiple apps. 
In such environments, it's often necessary to selectively enable or disable specific features or applications. This project addresses 
this need by creating a feature flag app that retrieves data from an API and utilizes keys to render the appropriate functions 
within the application.
```

### Key Features
- Dynamic Feature Management: Enable or disable specific features or applications dynamically.

- API Integration: Retrieve feature flag data from an external API to ensure real-time updates.

- Key-based Rendering: Utilize keys to determine which functions or components should be rendered based on the feature flag status.

- Scalable Architecture: Designed with scalability in mind to accommodate future expansions and modifications.

### Usage
```
Once the application is running, you can interact with it to manage 
feature flags.
```
 Here's how to use it:
1. Login: If authentication is required, log in to the application using your credentials.

2. View Feature Flags: Explore the list of feature flags retrieved from the API.

3. Enable/Disable Features: Toggle the feature flags to enable or disable specific functionalities.

4. Save Changes: Save any changes made to the feature flags. This may involve updating the flags' status in the API or local storage.

5. Refresh: If necessary, refresh the page to fetch the latest feature flag data from the API.
