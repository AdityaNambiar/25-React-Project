### ðŸš€ Introducing Project 17: Scroll to Top and Bottom Feature ðŸ“œ

```
Hello React enthusiasts! We're excited to present to you Project 17 
of our React project series: Scroll to Top and Bottom Feature. In 
this project, we'll implement a smooth scrolling functionality that
allows users to effortlessly navigate to the top and bottom of a page.
```

### Project Details:
- **Project Name:** Scroll to Top and Bottom Feature
- **Project Number:** 17 out of 25 React Projects

### Key Features:
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Implement smooth scrolling animation for a seamless user experience.
- **Scroll to Top Button:** Create a button that scrolls the page to the top when clicked.
- **Scroll to Bottom Button:** Implement a button that scrolls the page to the bottom with a single click.

### Implementation:
To achieve this functionality, we'll utilize the useRef hook and custom functions in React. By leveraging useRef, we'll efficiently access and manipulate DOM elements, ensuring a smooth scrolling experience. Our custom functions will handle the logic for scrolling to the top and bottom of the page.


### Happy Scrolling! ðŸš€
