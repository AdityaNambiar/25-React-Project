# 🖼️ Project 4: Image Slider 🖼️

In this project, I've created an Image Slider using React, showcasing a seamless way to navigate through a collection of images. Here's a breakdown of my approach:

🔍 Approach:
- Fetching Data: I utilized JavaScript to fetch data from a specified folder containing images. This dynamic approach ensures flexibility and scalability in managing image content.
- Auto Slide with useEffect: Leveraging React's useEffect hook, I implemented an auto-slide feature, enhancing user experience by smoothly transitioning between images without manual intervention.

🚀 I'm thrilled with the outcome and eager to hear your thoughts! Stay tuned for more exciting projects as I continue this series.
